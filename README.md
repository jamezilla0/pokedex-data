# pokedex-data
All data from main series Pokémon games, originally from the veekun/pokedex project, dumped as CSV files and SQLite DB.

The data source comes directly from the 
[`veekun/pokedex`](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) CSV files,
which are generated from
the ripped data of the videogames, 
but a [set of changes may be applied](https://github.com/metaunicorn/pokedex-admin#modifications) 
on top in order top optimize and tweak the database depending on the needs of this project.

In this project you will also find zipped SQLite files which is basically all the CSV
files dumped into SQL tables.

All these files are generated with the UI and command-line tools of the 
[`metaunicorn/pokedex-admin`](https://github.com/metaunicorn/pokedex-admin) project,
so for maintaining this project, it has to be done through that project (manual changes
will be no accepted).
